order of operations on your existing repo:
1) locally create a new gh_pages branch
2) delete all files from it except for the index.html and an image file if you have one
3) commit it and push it  with 'git push'
4) github will now require you to set the remote link and create the remote gh-pages branch, do what it says
5) once you do the above step try git push again, now it will work
6) browse to: https://spacether.github.io/appacademy_hw/ replace my username with yours, my repo name with yours. Your index.html file will be live there.

Yes.
I created a user repo: username.github.io, and I made a blank index.html for that repo.
Then I created a gh-pages branch on my homeworks project on my computer `git checkout -b gh-pages`
I deleted everything from the gh-pages branch, except the html file that I made for the last homework (which I renamed to index.html)
Then I committed `git commit -m "gh-pages setup"` and pushed changes `git push origin gh-pages`
Then, in Github, I made sure that my homeworks project (actually called 'aa-homeworks') was set to render the webpage from the gh-pages branch.
Then I went to username.github.io/aa-homeworks
